##  SOURCE BLOCK FORMAT CLASS
##
##  A simple class containing compiled regular expressions to detect
##  potential documentation format block comments within C source code.
##
##  The `column' pattern must contain a group to `unbox' the content of
##  documentation comment blocks.
##
##  Later on, paragraphs are converted to long lines, which simplifies the
##  regular expressions that act upon the text.

   * @Description:
   *   FreeType root face class structure.  A face object models a
   *   typeface in a font file.
   *   Hello *this* *is*: _Something'_ _special_
   *
   * @Fields:
   *   num_faces           :: The number of faces in the font file.  Some
   *                          font formats can have multiple faces in
   *                          a single font file.
   *
   *   face_index          :: This field holds two different values.
   *                          Bits 0-15 are the index of the face in the
   *                          font file (starting with value~0).  They
   *                          are set to~0 if there is only one face in
   *                          the font file.
   *
   *                          [Since 2.6.1] Bits 16-30 are relevant to GX
   *                          and OpenType variation fonts only, holding
   *                          the named instance index for the current
   *                          face index (starting with value~1; value~0
   *                          indicates font access without a named
   *                          instance).  For non-variation fonts, bits
   *                          16-30 are ignored.  If we have the third
   *                          named instance of face~4, say, `face_index'
   *                          is set to 0x00030004.
   *
   *                          Bit 31 is always zero (this is,
   *                          `face_index' is always a positive value).
   *
   *                          [Since 2.9] Changing the design coordinates
   *                          with @FT_Set_Var_Design_Coordinates or
   *                          @FT_Set_Var_Blend_Coordinates does not
   *                          influence the named instance index value
   *                          (only @FT_Set_Named_Instance does that).
   *
   *   face_flags          :: A set of bit flags that give important
   *                          information about the face; see
   *                          @FT_FACE_FLAG_XXX for the details.
   *
   *   style_flags         :: The lower 16~bits contain a set of bit
   *                          flags indicating the style of the face; see
   *                          @FT_STYLE_FLAG_XXX for the details.
   *
   *                          [Since 2.6.1] Bits 16-30 hold the number
   *                          of named instances available for the
   *                          current face if we have a GX or OpenType
   *                          variation (sub)font.  Bit 31 is always zero
   *                          (this is, `style_flags' is always a
   *                          positive value).  Note that a variation
   *                          font has always at least one named
   *                          instance, namely the default instance.
   *
   *   num_glyphs          :: The number of glyphs in the face.  If the
   *                          face is scalable and has sbits (see
   *                          `num_fixed_sizes'), it is set to the number
   *                          of outline glyphs.
   *
   *                          For CID-keyed fonts (not in an SFNT
   *                          wrapper) this value gives the highest CID
   *                          used in the font.
   *
   *   family_name         :: The face's family name.  This is an ASCII
   *                          string, usually in English, that describes
   *                          the typeface's family (like `Times New
   *                          Roman', `Bodoni', `Garamond', etc).  This
   *                          is a least common denominator used to list
   *                          fonts.  Some formats (TrueType & OpenType)
   *                          provide localized and Unicode versions of
   *                          this string.  Applications should use the
   *                          format specific interface to access them.
   *                          Can be NULL (e.g., in fonts embedded in a
   *                          PDF file).
   *
   *                          In case the font doesn't provide a specific
   *                          family name entry, FreeType tries to
   *                          synthesize one, deriving it from other name
   *                          entries.
   *
   *   style_name          :: The face's style name.  This is an ASCII
   *                          string, usually in English, that describes
   *                          the typeface's style (like `Italic',
   *                          `Bold', `Condensed', etc).  Not all font
   *                          formats provide a style name, so this field
   *                          is optional, and can be set to NULL.  As
   *                          for `family_name', some formats provide
   *                          localized and Unicode versions of this
   *                          string.  Applications should use the format
   *                          specific interface to access them.
   *
   *   num_fixed_sizes     :: The number of bitmap strikes in the face.
   *                          Even if the face is scalable, there might
   *                          still be bitmap strikes, which are called
   *                          `sbits' in that case.
   *
   *   available_sizes     :: An array of @FT_Bitmap_Size for all bitmap
   *                          strikes in the face.  It is set to NULL if
   *                          there is no bitmap strike.
   *
   *                          Note that FreeType tries to sanitize the
   *                          strike data since they are sometimes sloppy
   *                          or incorrect, but this can easily fail.
   *
   *   num_charmaps        :: The number of charmaps in the face.
   *
   *   charmaps            :: An array of the charmaps of the face.
   *
   *   generic             :: A field reserved for client uses.  See the
   *                          @FT_Generic type description.
   *
   *   bbox                :: The font bounding box.  Coordinates are
   *                          expressed in font units (see
   *                          `units_per_EM').  The box is large enough
   *                          to contain any glyph from the font.  Thus,
   *                          `bbox.yMax' can be seen as the `maximum
   *                          ascender', and `bbox.yMin' as the `minimum
   *                          descender'.  Only relevant for scalable
   *                          formats.
   *
   *                          Note that the bounding box might be off by
   *                          (at least) one pixel for hinted fonts.  See
   *                          @FT_Size_Metrics for further discussion.
   *
   *   units_per_EM        :: The number of font units per EM square for
   *                          this face.  This is typically 2048 for
   *                          TrueType fonts, and 1000 for Type~1 fonts.
   *                          Only relevant for scalable formats.
   *
   *   ascender            :: The typographic ascender of the face,
   *                          expressed in font units.  For font formats
   *                          not having this information, it is set to
   *                          `bbox.yMax'.  Only relevant for scalable
   *                          formats.
   *
   *   descender           :: The typographic descender of the face,
   *                          expressed in font units.  For font formats
   *                          not having this information, it is set to
   *                          `bbox.yMin'.  Note that this field is
   *                          negative for values below the baseline.
   *                          Only relevant for scalable formats.
   *
   *   height              :: This value is the vertical distance
   *                          between two consecutive baselines,
   *                          expressed in font units.  It is always
   *                          positive.  Only relevant for scalable
   *                          formats.
   *
   *                          If you want the global glyph height, use
   *                          `ascender - descender'.
   *
   *   max_advance_width   :: The maximum advance width, in font units,
   *                          for all glyphs in this face.  This can be
   *                          used to make word wrapping computations
   *                          faster.  Only relevant for scalable
   *                          formats.
   *
   *   max_advance_height  :: The maximum advance height, in font units,
   *                          for all glyphs in this face.  This is only
   *                          relevant for vertical layouts, and is set
   *                          to `height' for fonts that do not provide
   *                          vertical metrics.  Only relevant for
   *                          scalable formats.
   *
   *   underline_position  :: The position, in font units, of the
   *                          underline line for this face.  It is the
   *                          center of the underlining stem.  Only
   *                          relevant for scalable formats.
   *
   *   underline_thickness :: The thickness, in font units, of the
   *                          underline for this face.  Only relevant for
   *                          scalable formats.
   *
   *   glyph               :: The face's associated glyph slot(s).
   *
   *   size                :: The current active size for this face.
   *
   *   charmap             :: The current active charmap for this face.
   *
   * @Note:
   *   Fields may be changed after a call to @FT_Attach_File or
   *   @FT_Attach_Stream.
   *
   *   For an OpenType variation font, the values of the following fields
   *   can change after a call to @FT_Set_Var_Design_Coordinates (and
   *   friends) if the font contains an `MVAR' table: `ascender',
   *   `descender', `height', `underline_position', and
   *   `underline_thickness'.
   *
   *   Especially for TrueType fonts see also the documentation for
   *   @FT_Size_Metrics.
